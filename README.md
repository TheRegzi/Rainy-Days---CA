![website image](images/rainy-days-website-image.JPG)

This is the README file for my first front-end project called "Rainy Days." This project is a simple online clothing store that I have developed as part of my Front-End Development studies at Noroff Vocational School.

## Description
"Rainy Days" is an online clothing store that focuses on clothing for the fictional brand Rainy Days. Rainy Days is selling men's and women's rain jackets, with a target audience that are aged from 30 to 50, and are interested in different outdoor activities, hiking, skiing etc. 

The project includes basic HTML and CSS code to display the products and provide a simple and user-friendly experience for visitors. The aim of this project is to put into practice everything Iâ€™ve learned about HTML and CSS over the course by bringing my design to life.
